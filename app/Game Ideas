THEME:
    RPG around colors/shapes at first to make the animations as simple as possible. Shades/colors
    will indicate depth into different paths of trees and equipment. Not as cool as graphics but
    will make the game easy for me to progress through without worrying about art.
CREATE A VERSION OF THE GAME WITHOUT PRETTY UI AND WITHOUT TILE MOVEMENT
    make simple turn based combat and proper database/mutliplayer functionality before creating a final copy
    by doing this development will be faster and less tedious at first.
ACHIEVE MULTIPLAYER:
 I want this game to function as a multiplayer game, but in order to do that I need to first be able
 to make the game single player, after the game is single player, i need to make  "co-op" missions which
 yield greater rewards at greater efficiency
